```

    curl -fsSL https://pkgs.netbird.io/install.sh | sh
```
### Activate the client
``` /bin/sh
    netbird up
```
to start the netbird client. An URL will be shown in the Terminal/SSH session , looking like this `https://login.netbird.io/activate?user_code=XXXX-XXXX`open it in the Webbrowser and activate the Device.

### That's it
Now you can access the Mind 2 via `[HOSTNAME].netbird.cloud` on any device running the netbird client.
